Welcome to my home. 

I am an undergraduate majoring in data science and big data technology.

Mathematica is the language of nature. I firmly believe numbers and geometry imply the whole mathematics. Many great 
theories tend to be extremely mathematically elegant. 

I'm obsessed with neural networks and trying to build a theory of neural network systems through rigorous mathematical theory.

The process of exploration is tracing the essence of nature and enriches my spirit, so i'm content.

If you're interested in this or want to know more details, i'm glad that we can communicate via email.
