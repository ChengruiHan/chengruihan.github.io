Welcome to my home. Mathematica is the language of nature. I firmly believe numbers and geometry imply the whole mathematics. Many great theories tend to be extremely mathematically elegant. I'm obsessed with neural networks and trying to build a theory of neural network systems through rigorous mathematical theory. I don't know whether it will be a success. However, i wouldn't worry too much about worldly success. The process of exploration is tracing the essence of nature and enriches my spirit, so i'm content.

If you're interested in this, i'm glad that we can communicate via email.
